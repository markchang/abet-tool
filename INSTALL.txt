The following gives information that should assist you in getting the 
program installed and working.

I think the first step is to create the data directory and the sub-directories.
We simply created a directory and named it 'data'.  The top-level name is not critical
but the sub-directory and filenames are critical.

The first level directory must be:

<course>-<semesterYY>-<instructor>

A full directory example = CS2413-Fall08-Williams

Within each of those directories is:

<assignment>-<sequence>-<ABETCriteriaCodes>

Where:

assignment is the type of files being tracked. 

For instance: "Homework, Exam, Project, Quiz"

sequence is simply an integer 1-X

ABETCriteriaCodes is a string of all of the criteria that this assignment
satisfies.  

For instance:  KIABC

A full directory example = Project-4-KIABHC

Within each of these directories will be the Average, Worst, Best, Instructions,
and Solution entries.  They can be either directories or files but need to be named, Average, Worst, 
Best, Instructions, Solutions.  If a directory is used then within that is where you should place all of the
associated files for that exhibit.  

Now copy the dataselect.html file your desired location on your webserver and edit it to
match the course, instructor, semester, etc....  

IMPORTANT:  Be sure to edit the value of the "action=" in the form tag to point to the location of 
the showresults.pl script.

IMPORTANT:  The values passed to the perl script are case sensitive.  So beware.  In other words any
of the search criteria is case-sensitive and hence when the grep is done it will affect the results.
Removal of case sensitivity would require editing the perl script to fix the regex's to ignore case.

Now place the showresults.pl script in a place it can be executed by your
webserver.  This location should match the action parameter in the form tag of the dataselect.html.  

IMPORTANT:  You must edit the datadir and webpath variables to match the locations on your webserver.

Once you have the initial structure created you can begin using the data retrieval tool.  As new
results come in save them as outlined above and they will be available for retrieval.
